# DS004 — Model Routing

## Summary

Soul Gateway routes every request through a model record in `snapshot.models`.

Each model has a `strategyKind`:

- `direct` — dispatch one provider/model pair
- `cascade` — walk an ordered list of child models until one succeeds

The runtime no longer has a separate tier execution path. A tier is just a cascade model stored in the unified model tables.

The dashboard still exposes a dedicated `Tiers` page and `/management/tiers` management surface, but that UI edits the same cascade model records in `models` + `model_children`; it is not a separate runtime subsystem.

The embeddings route also resolves models through `snapshot.models`. For cascade models on `POST /v1/embeddings`, candidate children are restricted to enabled direct models tagged `embeddings`, so a general chat tier such as `fast` is not accidentally used for vector generation.

## Model registry

The snapshot loader reads models from the unified schema:

- `models`
- `model_aliases`
- `model_children`
- `providers`
- `middleware_bindings`
- `model_cooldowns`

`snapshot.models` contains both direct and cascade models. The snapshot no longer relies on `tiers`, `tier_models`, or a synthesized in-memory tier map.

## Model-name normalization

`normalizeModelName(input, snapshot)` resolves names in this order:

1. exact `snapshot.models` match
2. alias match
3. bare-name lookup across direct-model `<provider>/<name>` keys only
4. case-insensitive retry

Bare cascade shorthand such as `fast -> axl/fast` is no longer supported. Cascade models must be addressed by their full model key (for example `axl/fast`).

The normalizer returns:

- `kind: 'model'`
- `kind: 'unknown'`

## Direct models

A direct model dispatches through the kernel-composed direct chain (see DS003 §"Model execution chain"):

```text
bindDirectTarget       // normalize model+provider records on ctx.target
concurrency            // outer slot lifecycle (held across retries)
retry(attemptChain)    // wraps the per-attempt subchain
finalizeDirectResult   // shape into chat-completion envelope
```

Each per-attempt subchain runs `attemptContext → timeout → credentialLease → providerBindings (provider middleware + backendDispatch)` in a forked kernel context.

## Cascade models

A cascade model stores an ordered `children` list loaded from `model_children`.

`modelExecutionMiddleware()` runs cascade models through the kernel-composed cascade chain:

```text
finalizeDirectResult        // preserve child envelope/stream or shape buffered leaf result
invokeModelCapability       // installs ctx.invokeModel(...)
cascadeAdapter (terminal)   // runs cascadeMiddleware over children
```

For each attempt the cascade middleware:

- skips children already failed in this request
- skips cooled-down child models
- skips disabled child models
- invokes the next eligible child with `ctx.invokeModel(model)` and reads the finished child ctx
- stops on first success

If every child fails or is unavailable, the runtime throws `TierExhaustedError`.

## Cooldowns

When a model fails with a classified cooldown-triggering error, the runtime records a cooldown entry and future cascades skip that model until the cooldown expires or is cleared. The loop has a read side bound to the snapshot and a write side bound to the cascade attempt that just failed.

### Read side — snapshot

`snapshot.cooldowns` is a `Set<modelKey>` built at snapshot load time from `model_cooldowns` rows where `cleared_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()`. The cascade adapter in `src/runtime/execution/model-execution.mjs` filters out any child whose `modelKey` is in that set before computing the next candidate, so a request bound to a fresh snapshot never attempts a cooled-down model.

### Write side — cascade hook

`gatewayDispatchMiddleware` installs `ctx.metadata.onCooldown(modelKey, err)` on every request. The cascade middleware invokes it when a child attempt throws an error with `err.cooldown === true`. The hook calls `cooldownsDao.create()` with:

- `modelId` resolved from `snapshot.models.get(modelKey).id`
- `reasonType` and `reasonMessage` from the triggering `GatewayError`
- `requestId` from the current ctx
- `expiresAt = now + cooldownMs`

Cooldown duration precedence:

1. `err.cooldownMs` if the backend error attaches one (future `Retry-After` parsing)
2. `model.retryPolicy.cooldownMs` per-model override
3. `appCtx.config.env.COOLDOWN_DURATION_MS` global default (1 hour)

The write is fire-and-forget: cascade semantics must not wait for persistence to advance to the next child. On successful write the hook calls `requestRuntimeRefresh(appCtx, { snapshot: true })` so the next snapshot generation carries the new entry. Write or refresh failures log at `warn` level and are swallowed — the in-flight request has already moved on.

### Cleanup

`src/background/scheduler.mjs` runs `cooldownsDao.deleteExpired()` every 60 seconds to drop rows whose `expires_at` has passed. Admin-initiated clears live in `src/management/cooldowns-route.mjs` (`DELETE /management/cooldowns[/:modelId]`), which call `clearAll` / `clearByModel` and then trigger the same async snapshot refresh.

## Concurrency

Each direct model enforces a per-model concurrency limit.

- requests wait in a queue when the limit is saturated
- queue timeout rejects with a retryable error
- metrics expose active/max/waiting counts

## Pricing

Models can define:

- token-based pricing
- per-request pricing
- free-model status

Cost is calculated from the model record after each request and feeds budget enforcement and audit logging.

## Model metadata and tagging

Model rows carry pricing, context, capability, and tag metadata that is used by the dashboard, the `/v1/models` listing, and (where it affects routing like `isFree` or `contextWindow`) the request pipeline. Metadata precedence is owned by the shared `enrichModelMetadata()` helper in `src/runtime/policy/model-metadata-classifier.mjs`.

It is applied in three in-memory contexts:

1. `src/runtime/providers/auto-provisioner.mjs` — provider create / OAuth completion / patch-with-credentials / resync / startup reconciliation.
2. `src/management/models-route.mjs` — the `/management/models` list overlay and the `/management/models/providers/:key/models` Add-Model discovery overlay.
3. `src/public-api/register-routes.mjs` — direct-model `/v1/models` entries run the same helper against the already-loaded snapshot record plus the already-installed pricing directory, so older sparse rows still render enriched `_pricing`, `_context`, `_tags`, and `_is_free` without a resync.

The enrichment pipeline is strict-precedence:

1. **Provider-supplied metadata wins.** If the provider's own `/models` response surfaced pricing, context, a capability flag, or a tag, that value is preserved — the directory and the classifier never overwrite it (explicit provider values like `supportsVision: false` also win over optimistic directory claims).
2. **Pricing directory fills remaining gaps.** `src/runtime/policy/pricing-directory.mjs` keeps an OpenRouter-backed model catalog in memory and matches by exact id, canonical slug, curated provider-alias rewrite (NVIDIA `meta/` → `meta-llama/`, Codex models → `openai/`, Copilot vendor prefixes), and finally unique leaf slug. Matching is deterministic; there is no fuzzy search, so adversarial inputs stay unresolved. Directory-sourced fields are stamped in `row.metadata.openrouter` for provenance.
3. **Curated static overrides apply exact gateway billing semantics and gap-fills.** `src/runtime/policy/curated-model-metadata.mjs` ships a small static table of exact-model overrides plus provider-level free-model rules. It can fill missing token prices or context when neither the provider nor OpenRouter supplied them, and it can set gateway billing semantics like `isFree:true` for catalogs such as NVIDIA even when the upstream directory still reports nonzero token prices. Curated fields never replace provider/directory price or context values that already exist. Curated provenance is stamped in `row.metadata.curated`.
4. **Classifier adds curated family/domain tags.** The classifier owns `PREDEFINED_MODEL_TAGS`, the family rule set (coding, reasoning, agentic, fast, long-context, instruction-following, multilingual, multimodal, creative, writing, research, finance, medical, etc.), and `TOOL_CALLING_PROVIDER_KEYS` for augmenting `tool-calling` on trusted providers (with explicit opt-outs such as `copilot/gpt-4o`). The classifier is pure and has no side effects. It **never** emits capability-signal tags (`vision`, `audio`, `tool-calling` from direct signal, `structured-outputs`, `moderated`, `free`) — those come from provider or directory data only. Classifier-sourced tags are stamped in `row.metadata.classifier`.

Models marked with `metadata.discoverySource = 'ploinky-agent-discovery'` use an agent-owned tag contract instead of the tag stages above. Their incoming `tags` array is preserved exactly in persisted, management, and public views. Directory and curated enrichment may still fill pricing, limits, free status, and structured capability fields, but neither those sources nor the classifier may add tags. Umbrella tags such as `coding-agent` therefore do not expand into redundant `coding`, `agentic`, or `tool-calling` tags.

When a synchronized Ploinky-agent model changes tags, Soul Gateway reconciles only that model's membership in auto-generated tag tiers. It removes bindings for tags no longer present, appends bindings for current tags, and may lazily create a missing predefined tier needed by that agent. Existing tier rows, manually managed tiers, and provider-model tier behavior are preserved.

Embedding models are identified by the existing `embeddings` tag. The classifier adds that tag for embedding-family names such as `embed`, `e5-`, and `bge-`. Tag-tier bootstrap creates the `embeddings` tier like every other predefined tag tier, so callers use `model: "embeddings"` for the default embedding cascade.

Persisted model rows only reflect whatever the last discovery/sync pass wrote. For older sparse rows, the management list and public `/v1/models` surfaces run the same in-memory enrichment helper on top of the stored row so the dashboard and public model list can show enriched metadata without mutating the DB or issuing DB/network calls from the route.

## Public model listing

`GET /v1/models` returns the OpenAI-compatible model list derived from `snapshot.models` plus `snapshot.aliases`. The base entry shape (`id`, `object`, `created`, `owned_by`, `permission`, `root`, `parent`) is preserved so vanilla OpenAI clients keep working.

Gateway-specific extensions use the `_`-prefix convention so they cannot collide with a future OpenAI field:

- `_alias: true` and `root`/`parent` pointing at the target on alias entries
- `_strategy: 'cascade'` with `_child_count`, `_billing_types`, and a derived `_is_free` (true iff every enabled child resolves as free) on cascade models
- `_pricing`, `_context`, `_tags`, and `_is_free` on direct models, sourced from the snapshot record after the same in-memory enrichment precedence is applied

The handler does not issue DB queries or network calls; it reads the already-loaded snapshot and the already-installed in-memory pricing directory only.
