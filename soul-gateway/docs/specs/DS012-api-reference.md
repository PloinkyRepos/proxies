# DS012 — Management API & Dashboard

## Summary

This spec describes the dashboard and management endpoints at a capability level.

The management surface exposes the active dashboard and admin APIs for the current runtime and schema.

The dashboard shell served at `/management` loads its frontend entrypoint from `/management/js/app.mjs` as a classic browser script. The file publishes the Alpine component factories and template-visible helpers onto `window`, so expressions like `x-data="app()"`, `formatTime(...)`, and `getModelPricingView(...)` resolve directly during Alpine initialization.

## Dashboard authentication

- management routes are exposed through Ploinky's protected Router path at `/base-agent-additional-server/soul-gateway/7000/management/`
- Ploinky login is the only browser-facing admin login; Soul Gateway does not create dashboard sessions
- management auth validates `x-ploinky-auth-info` plus the Ploinky router-request JWT and requires an admin role
- dashboard cookies, bearer dashboard tokens, and caller-supplied identity headers are rejected as management auth
- compatibility endpoints under `/management/auth/*` return HTTP 410 with instructions to use Ploinky login
- state-changing management requests do not require Soul Gateway CSRF tokens; the protected-service invocation JWT is the request binding
- live-refresh behavior on data-backed tabs

## Current management session

`GET /management/me` returns the current management session as verified by Ploinky router auth. The response is non-secret and is used by the dashboard to prefill API key ownership fields.

Response:

```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "source": "router-sso",
  "user": {
    "id": "local:admin",
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@example.test",
    "roles": ["admin"],
    "keyOwner": "admin"
  }
}
```

`keyOwner` is derived from the verified user in this order: `username`, `name`, `id`, `email`. It is normalized to Soul Gateway's owner grammar `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`; colon-prefixed local ids such as `local:admin` become `admin`.

## Provider management

The dashboard and API support:

- create, list, update, delete providers
- provider template catalog
- connectivity tests
- OAuth flow initiation/completion
- account management
- model discovery/sync

Current contract details:

- provider create/update requests use canonical camelCase fields such as `providerKey`, `displayName`, `adapterKey`, `authStrategy`, `providerMode`, `oauthAdapterKey`, `baseUrl`, and `apiKey`
- provider responses are DB-row shaped snake_case objects from `provider-view.mjs` (for example `provider_key`, `display_name`, `adapter_key`, `auth_strategy`)
- provider create/update rejects unknown `adapterKey` values and backend-invalid provider config before the row is written
- provider create with usable credentials performs initial model discovery synchronously; if the initial sync fails, the request fails and the newly-created provider row is removed
- provider create rollback also removes any partially inserted discovered model rows for that provider before deleting the provider record, so failed initial sync returns the create error instead of a foreign-key `500`
- provider update with `apiKey` performs the same strict model sync before the request reports success; if that sync fails, the PATCH returns an error
- provider delete removes provider-seeded direct models (`discovery_source != 'manual'`) before deleting the provider row; delete still rejects when manual models remain attached to the provider
- `POST /management/providers/:providerId/test` returns `{ ok, detail, latencyMs }`; `detail` is passed through from the backend module without translation to `message`/`error`
- `POST /management/providers/:providerId/discover-models` returns the raw backend discovery descriptors (`modelId`, `displayName`, `contextWindow`, `supportsTools`, `supportsStreaming`, `supportsVision`, optional `pricing`, ...)
- the live provider View/Models modal uses discovery for inspection and manual-add fallback; persisted provider catalog maintenance belongs to the shared sync path
- provider create/update/delete performs a synchronous runtime snapshot refresh before returning success

`provider_mode` exposes:

- `external_api`
- `custom`

## Provider pipeline composer

The Providers page exposes a pipeline composer backed by backend- and middleware-named endpoints:

- `GET /management/backends` — backend module inventory from the unified backend catalog. Each entry exposes `{ key, name, kind }`.
- `GET /management/provider-middlewares` — registered provider middleware modules
- `GET /management/providers/:providerId/middlewares` — flat ordered list of provider-scope bindings
- `POST /management/providers/:providerId/middlewares` — create a provider-scope binding
- `PATCH /management/providers/:providerId/middlewares/:bindingId` — update a binding (sort order, settings, enabled)
- `DELETE /management/providers/:providerId/middlewares/:bindingId` — delete a binding

Current implementation details:

- provider middleware bindings live in unified `middleware_bindings` with `scope='provider'`
- the binding payload is a flat ordered array, sorted by the DB `sort_order` and exposed through the API as `sortOrder`; there is no phase column
- the dashboard composer renders one ordered provider-middleware list, matching the runtime's single provider binding chain
- the provider's terminal backend is selected via `providers.adapter_key`; the snapshot exposes it as `provider.backendKey`. There is no separate `executor_key` or transport key column.
- create rejects unknown provider middleware keys before writing `middleware_bindings`
- create/update/delete performs a synchronous runtime snapshot refresh before returning success

## Model management

The dashboard and API support:

- direct-model CRUD
- tier CRUD over cascade models
- enable/disable
- pricing and concurrency configuration

Current contract details:

- the `Models` dashboard tab edits direct models only, even though `GET /management/models` still returns unified model rows from the database
- the `Models` page remains DB-backed; it does not list live provider catalogs directly in the main table
- `GET /management/models` overlays missing pricing, context, and tags through the shared `enrichModelMetadata()` pipeline (provider value > pricing directory > curated static overrides > local classifier — see DS002 §Auto-provisioning and DS004 §"Model metadata and tagging"), so older DB rows still render enriched metadata without a manual resync; Ploinky-agent rows preserve their stored agent-supplied tags exactly while still receiving structured metadata fills; curated provenance lands in `row.metadata.curated`; classifier provenance lands in `row.metadata.classifier`
- `GET /management/models/providers` lists all enabled providers, not just providers that already have persisted model rows
- `GET /management/models/providers/:key/models` is a recovery path for the Add Model modal: it performs live discovery for that provider, runs the same `enrichModelMetadata()` pipeline, and returns model-option rows shaped for the modal (`provider_model_id`, `display_name`, pricing fields, capabilities, tags, metadata)
- `GET /management/models/tags` returns `PREDEFINED_MODEL_TAGS ∪ distinct stored tags`, sorted — the predefined taxonomy (capability-signal tags plus curated family/domain tags) keeps the dashboard tag-filter vocabulary stable even when the DB has no tagged rows yet
- the Add Model modal now persists the discovered `capabilities`, `tags`, and `metadata` fields along with pricing when it creates a manual direct-model row
- the Models page search matches `model_key`, `display_name`, `provider_key`, `provider_model_id`, and any of the model's `tags`
- the Models page pricing column no longer exposes the raw `external_directory` storage mode. It renders request prices as `$X.XXX/req`, renders token prices whenever numeric token prices are present even if the row's persisted mode is still `external_directory`, renders `$0/0` for rows marked free with no token prices, and renders `-` when pricing is still unresolved
- the `Tiers` dashboard tab edits cascade models through `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /management/tiers` plus `POST /management/tiers/:tierId/enable|disable`
- tier create/update requests use camelCase fields: `tierKey`, `displayName`, `enabled`, `maxAttempts`, `childModelIds`
- tier responses use a dashboard-specific view model:
  `{ id, tierKey, displayName, enabled, maxAttempts, children: [{ bindingId, modelId, modelKey, displayName, enabled, priority }] }`
- the tier management surface is an editor over `models(strategy_kind='cascade')` plus `model_children`; it does not reintroduce a separate tier runtime abstraction

Provider model sync semantics:

- `POST /management/providers/:providerId/sync-models` is the manual management entrypoint that invokes the shared upstream discovery/sync path also used by provider create/update, OAuth completion, startup refresh, and background refresh
- when the request body omits `discoveries`, the endpoint runs live upstream discovery before syncing; when descriptors are provided, it syncs those descriptors through the same normalization and enrichment pipeline
- sync inserts new discovered rows, updates previously discovered non-manual rows, disables missing synced rows with `metadata.syncDisabled`, re-enables returning sync-disabled rows, preserves operator-disabled rows as disabled, and preserves `discovery_source='manual'` rows
- the dashboard exposes this endpoint as a persistent Sync action; the live View/Models modal remains an inspection/manual-add fallback rather than the primary catalog refresh control

## Middleware management

The dashboard and API support:

- middleware catalog listing
- middleware metadata updates
- rescan
- binding management via `/management/models/:modelId/middlewares`

Bindings write to unified `middleware_bindings` with `scope='model'` and `target_id` pointing to the model.

## Other management surfaces

- API key management — admins can provision user keys with `POST /management/keys`. The dashboard defaults the owner field from `GET /management/me`'s `user.keyOwner`, but this is only an editable dashboard default: `POST /management/keys` still requires a valid `subjectId` shaped `user:<owner>:<name>`, and admins may intentionally override the owner before creating a key. The endpoint creates a policy row for a router-signed user subject with `subject_type='user'` and `source='signed-subject'`; the router mints the copied bearer value as `sk-soul-<base64url(user:<owner>:<name>|<signature>)>`, and Soul Gateway stores no raw key material. Agent keys remain discovery-provisioned, cannot be provisioned through this endpoint, and are non-revocable through key management. User keys are revocable; a revoked user subject id cannot be reused, so rotation requires a new key name. The `status` field on each key row reflects `active` or `revoked`.
- blacklist management
- cooldown management
- logs
- metrics dashboards — `/management/metrics/usage` returns the compatibility `data` bucket rows plus dashboard fields `total`, `models`, `daily_by_model`, and `model_requests`; `/management/metrics/activity` returns compatibility time-bucket `data` plus `by_key` per-key aggregates. Both are derived from `audit_logs`, and usage accepts `model` and `api_key_id` filters.
- export

Mutations that affect routing or policy trigger runtime refresh so later requests observe the new state.

## Decisions & Questions

1. 2026-06-24: Per `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-create-user-keys.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-create-user-keys-design.md`, `POST /management/keys` is the admin user-key provisioning endpoint, not an agent-key creation endpoint. It stores only signed-subject policy for `user:<owner>:<name>`, leaves minting to the Ploinky router, preserves non-revocable discovery-owned agent keys, and enforces the burned-name rule for revoked user subjects.
2. 2026-06-27: The dashboard shows admin-created user keys only in the encoded `sk-soul-...` form returned by Ploinky. The gateway decodes that wrapper for verification and rejects raw user signed-subject bearer tokens.
3. 2026-06-29: The management dashboard may prefill user-key ownership only from the server-verified `/management/me` response. Browser state is not an identity source, and the create-key API remains responsible for validating the explicit `subjectId`.
